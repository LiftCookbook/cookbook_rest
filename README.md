Code examples for the REST chapter of the Lift Cookbook
================================================

This project contains examples from the [Lift Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029151.do), online at [http://cookbook.liftweb.net/](http://cookbook.liftweb.net/).

To run this application:

* Install SBT from http://www.scala-sbt.org/

* Start SBT using `sbt` (Mac and Linux) or `sbt.bat` (Windows)

* In SBT, `container:start`

There's nothing to see in a browser: these examples work best with [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) or [HTTPie](http://httpie.org).
